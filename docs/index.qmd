# MIKE IO 1D: input/output of MIKE 1D files in Python

![Python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mikeio1d.svg) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/mikeio1d.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/mikeio1d)

Read, manipulate, and analyze res1d, res, resx, out, and xns11 files.

For other MIKE files (dfs0, dfs1, dfs2, dfsu, and mesh files), refer to [MIKE IO](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio)

::: callout-warning
MIKE IO 1D is under development and could be subject to changes.
:::

## Requirements

-   Windows, Linux (experimental)
-   Python x64 3.9 - 3.12
-   (Windows) [VC++ redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads%3E) (already installed if you have MIKE)
-   (Linux) [.NET Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux) (not installed by default)

## Installation

```bash
pip install mikeio1d
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Using MIKE IO 1D with Linux?"}
Linux users will need to install .NET runtime. If you're on the development branch, you need .NET SDK. Ubuntu users can install these dependencies as follows:

```bash      
sudo apt install dotnet-runtime-8.0
```

``` bash     
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0
```
:::

## Getting started

```{python}
from mikeio1d import Res1D

res = Res1D("data/network.res1d")
df = res.read()
df.head()
```
