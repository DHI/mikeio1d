If you want to try one of the examples you need to first download some data files.

The files are stored on GitHub in the [MIKE IO 1D repo](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio1d).

The easiest way is to the download the repo as a [zip file](https://github.com/DHI/mikeio1d/archive/main.zip) and extract the files you need.

In the zip file you find the files in `tests/testdata/` folder.
