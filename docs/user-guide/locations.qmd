title: Locations
---

Locations are where model results exist in the [Network](network.qmd). The main location types are nodes, reaches, gridpoints, and catchments.

```{python}
from mikeio1d import Res1D
res = Res1D('../data/network.res1d')
res_catchments = Res1D('../data/catchments.res1d')
```
:::

## Data structures
There are two main data structures for locations: location collections and single locations.

### Location collections
Access location collections from a [Res1D](res1d.qmd) object. Each collection shows available quantities and location IDs.

```{python}	
res.nodes
```

```{python}	
res.reaches
```

```{python}
res_catchments.catchments
```

::: callout-note
Gridpoints only exist as single locations on a reach, and have no collection.
:::

### Single locations
Access a single location by indexing its respective collection with its unique ID. Each location shows available quantities and static properties.

```{python}	
res.nodes['1']
```

```{python}
res.reaches['100l1']
```

```{python}
# gridpoint on reach 100l1 at chainage 23.841
res.reaches['100l1']['23.841']
```

::: callout-tip
Gridpoints can also be indexed by number instead of chainage. For example:
```{python}
#| output: false
res.reaches['100l1'][0]  # first gridpoint
res.reaches['100l1'][-1] # last gridpoint
```
:::

```{python}
res_catchments.catchments['100_16_16']
```

## Quantities

[Quantities](quantities.qmd) are the actual model results. Each single location or location collection has associated quantities.

```{python}
res.nodes.WaterLevel
```
```{python}
res.nodes['1'].WaterLevel
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Can't find a which location a quantity belongs to?"}
The [Network](network.qmd) structure is generic and applies across different domains (e.g. collection systems, water distribution, rivers). Sometimes this can be challenging to find a particular result. Here are some examples of result types mapped onto this structure.

| Location  | Example quantities |
|-----------|--------------------|
|Nodes      | Water level (e.g. manhole, basin, outlet, junction) |
|           | Pump discharge in structure |
|Reaches    | Discharge (e.g. pipes, pumps, weirs) |
|           | Water level (e.g. at specific chainges) |
|Catchments | Catchment discharge |
|           | Total runoff |
|Global     | Water balance |
|           | User defined variable types |
:::

Refer to the [Quantities](quantities.qmd) page for more information on how to read and plot the returned quantities.

## Static attributes
Each location has a set of static attributes.

```{python}
res.nodes['1'].ground_level
```


## Reading data
All result data for a single location or location collection can be read into a pandas DataFrame.
```{python}
df = res.reaches['100l1'].read()
df.head()
```
```{python}
df = res.reaches.read()
df.head()
```

## GeoDataFrames

Locations collections can be extracted into a GeoDataFrame, both with and without quantities.

```{python}
gdf = res.reaches.to_geopandas()
gdf.plot()
```

```{python}
gdf = res.reaches.to_geopandas(agg='max')
gdf.plot(column='max_Discharge', linewidth=3, cmap='RdYlGn_r', legend=True)
```
